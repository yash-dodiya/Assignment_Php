What is object-relational mapping (ORM)?


Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a way to align programming code with database 
structures.ORM uses metadata descriptors to create a layer between the programming
language and a relational database. It thus connects object-oriented program (OOP)
code with the database and simplifies the interaction between relational databases
 and OOP languages.

The idea of ORM is based on abstraction. The ORM mechanism makes it possible to 
address, access and manipulate objects without having to consider how those 
objects relate to their data sources. ORM lets programmers maintain a consistent 
view of objects over time, even as the sources that deliver them, the sinks that 
receive them and the applications that access them change.

Developers can also perform various data creating, reading, updating and deleting
(CRUD) operations in relational databases without using SQL. This capability is 
particularly useful for developers who either don't know SQL or don't want to 
waste time writing SQL code. With ORM, they don't have to understand and write 
SQL or rely on SQL query builders to add an abstraction layer to the SQL code.
