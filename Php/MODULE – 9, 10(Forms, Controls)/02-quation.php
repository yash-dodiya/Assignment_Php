Q-2:Explain -  Eloquent Relationships
⦁	Eloquent relationships are defined as methods on your Eloquent model classes. Since, like Eloquent models themselves, relationships also serve as powerful query builders, defining relationships as methods provides powerful method chaining and querying capabilities. For example, we may chain additional constraints on this posts relationship:
One To One
One To Many
Many To Many
Has Many Through
Polymorphic Relations
Many To Many Polymorphic Relations
